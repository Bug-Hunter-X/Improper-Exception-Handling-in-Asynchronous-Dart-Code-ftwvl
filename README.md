# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart code where exceptions are caught within a try-catch block, but the application doesn't handle them properly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  The example focuses on asynchronous operations using `Future` and `http` package.

## Bug Description

The `fetchData` function attempts to fetch data from an API. If there's an error (network issue, invalid API response etc.), the exception is caught. However, the code only prints the error message to the console and doesn't take any further action to recover or gracefully handle the failure.  This could lead to the application hanging, displaying an error that isn't user-friendly, or producing incorrect output.

## Solution

The solution involves improved exception handling.  Instead of simply logging the error, the solution provides multiple options to handle the error appropriately, including returning a default value, displaying a user-friendly error message, or retrying the request.
